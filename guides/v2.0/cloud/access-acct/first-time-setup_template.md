This section discusses how to get started with a Magento cloud deployment by cloning an existing sample project. You can customize your project to your needs anytime, including before you deploy it.

Use this procedure whether you're starting a new project from scratch or if you're importing an existing Magento installation to Enterprise Cloud Edition.

When you initially set up a project from a template, we retrieve the code from the [`magento-cloud-configuration` repository](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud-configuration){:target="_blank"}.
