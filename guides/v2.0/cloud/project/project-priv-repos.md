Your {{site.data.var.ece}} project can include code located in a private Git repository (for example, a {% glossarytooltip c1e4242b-1f1a-44c3-9d72-1d5b1435e142 %}module{% endglossarytooltip %} or theme). To do so, you must add your project's public SSH key to your private Git repository and update your project's `composer.json`.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  <p>To add a deployment key to your private GitHub repository, you must be the administrator of that repository.</p>
</div>

GitHub allows you to use a deploy key for one repository only.

If your project needs to access multiple repositories, you can choose to
attach an SSH key to an automated user account. Because this account won't
be used by a human, it's referred to as a [*machine user*](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/){:target="_blank"}. You can then add the
machine account as collaborator or add the machine user to a team with
access to the repositories it needs to manipulate.

### Find your deploy key
To find your project SSH public key (also referred to as a *deploy key*):

1.	Log in to your project using the Web Interface.

5.	See [Enter your GitHub deploy key](#cloud-deploykey-github).

### Enter your GitHub deploy key {#cloud-deploykey-github}

repository.

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  		<p>If you don't see this option, you're not the repository administrator and you cannot complete this task. Ask your GitHub project administrator to do this.</p>
	</div>

3.	On the Settings page, in the left navigation bar, click **Deploy Keys** as the following figure shows.

	![GitHub deploy key]({{ site.baseurl }}/common/images/cloud_gh-deploy-key.png){:width="200px"}
